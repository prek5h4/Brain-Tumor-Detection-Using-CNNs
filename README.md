## üöÄ Project Overview

This project implements a CNN model to classify brain MRI scans into two categories: **Tumor** and **Non-Tumor**. The complete workflow involves data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, performance evaluation, and visualization of the results to ensure high accuracy and reliability.

---

## üìä Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset of brain MRI images.

* **Source**: [Kaggle Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)
* **Total Images**: 253
* **Classes**:
    * `yes` (Tumor Detected)
    * `no` (No Tumor Detected)
* **Preprocessing**: To ensure model efficiency and accuracy, the following preprocessing steps were applied:
    * **Resizing**: Images were resized to a uniform `128x128` pixels.
    * **Normalization**: Pixel values were scaled to a range of `[0, 1]`.
    * **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, horizontal/vertical flips, and zooming were used to expand the dataset and prevent overfitting.

---

##  Methodology

The core of this project is a CNN designed for image classification.

* **CNN Architecture**: The model consists of multiple convolutional layers with `ReLU` activation, followed by `MaxPooling2D` layers for feature extraction. `Dropout` layers are included for regularization, and the final classification is performed by dense layers with a `sigmoid` activation function.
* **Training Parameters**:
    * **Optimizer**: Adam
    * **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy
    * **Epochs**: 25
    * **Batch Size**: 32
* **Evaluation Metrics**: The model's performance was assessed using:
    * Accuracy
    * Precision, Recall & F1-Score
    * Confusion Matrix

---

##  Results

The trained model achieved a high level of performance on the test dataset.

* **Test Accuracy**: `97.5%`
* **Loss**: `0.08`
