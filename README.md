## Project Overview

This project implements a CNN-based model to classify MRI brain scans as tumor or non-tumor. The workflow includes preprocessing, building and training the CNN model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing results.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Add dataset source link here]  
- **Number of images:** [Add total images]  
- **Classes:** Tumor, Non-Tumor (or specify tumor types if multiple)  
- **Preprocessing:** Resizing, normalization, data augmentation (rotation, flip, etc.)

---

## Methodology

- **Preprocessing:** Images resized to uniform dimensions, normalized, and augmented.  
- **CNN Architecture:** Multiple convolutional and pooling layers, dropout for regularization, dense layers for classification.  
- **Training:** Optimizer: [e.g., Adam], Loss: [e.g., categorical crossentropy], Epochs: [number], Batch size: [number]  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
